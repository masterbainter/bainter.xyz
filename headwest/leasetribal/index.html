    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Sky Blue Accent -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured as a tabbed interface with five sections: Overview, The Process, Key Rules, Location, and Contacts. This design was chosen because the source material (answers to the user's query) is procedural and informational, not data-driven. A tabbed structure breaks the complex process into logical, digestible chunks, allowing the user to navigate directly to their area of interest (e.g., "The Process") without being overwhelmed. This is superior to a long, scrolling document for usability and clarity. The primary interaction is clicking the tabs, which dynamically displays the relevant content pane. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Report Info: The overall process. Goal: Organize/Inform. Viz/Method: A vertical step-by-step diagram built with HTML/CSS/Tailwind (styled divs, borders, and icons) in "The Process" tab. Interaction: Visual flow. Justification: A visual process flow is much easier to understand than text alone and is responsive. 2. Report Info: Key "Players" (BIA, Tribe). Goal: Inform. Viz/Method: A simple 2-column grid in the "Overview" section. Interaction: None. Justification: Clearly delineates responsibilities. 3. Report Info: Key Rules (Federal vs. Tribal). Goal: Compare/Inform. Viz/Method: A 2-column text layout in the "Key Rules" tab. Interaction: None. Justification: Easy side-by-side comparison. 4. Report Info: Location constraints. Goal: Inform. Viz/Method: A bulleted list of "Constraints" in the "Location" tab. Interaction: None. Justification: Clearly lists the "catches." CONFIRMS NO SVG/Mermaid. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    <p class="mb-4 text-stone-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Most land on the reservation is "trust land," which means the federal government (through the Bureau of Indian Affairs) holds the legal title in trust for the benefit of the Tribe or individual members (allottees). You don't "buy" this land like property off-reservation; you obtain a lease, which is a legal agreement to use the land for a specific purpose and time.

                        <li><strong>Allotted Land:</strong> Land held in trust for an individual tribal member or their heirs. Leasing this land can be very complex as it requires consent from all co-owners.</li>

                            <li><strong>Enrollment:</strong> You must be an enrolled member to qualify for a tribal homesite lease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Land Use & Zoning:</strong> The Tribe has a land-use plan that designates areas for residential, agricultural, or conservation use. Your request must match this plan.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lot Size:</strong> The Tribe likely has rules on the maximum and minimum size of a homesite lot (e.g., 1-2.5 acres).</li>
                            <li><strong>Tribal Approval:</strong> The Tribal Council or a designated lands committee will likely need to approve your application.</li>

                        It's crucial to distinguish between the annual lease payment and the one-time costs of getting the lease and preparing the land. Costs are subject to change and must be confirmed with the BIA and RST Land Office.

                                For enrolled tribal members, homesite leases on tribal land are often for a
                                <strong>nominal fee</strong> (e.g., $1.00 per year). This is a policy
                                to support member housing, though federal rules technically require
                                "fair market value" unless an exception is made.

                            <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
                                These are the significant, often one-time, expenses required *before*
                                you can build.

                                <li><strong>Application/Admin Fees:</strong> The Tribe or BIA may charge fees to process the application and lease documents.</li>
                                <li><strong>Survey & Platting:</strong> You may have to pay for a certified survey to create a legal description of your lot.</li>
                                <li><strong>Environmental/Cultural Review:</strong> The cost for the required NEPA and archaeological surveys may be passed on to the applicant.</li>
                                <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> This is the largest potential cost. You are typically responsible for connecting to utilities (water, power, sewer). If the site is remote, this can cost tens of thousands of dollars.</li>

                        <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> While the lease itself may be inexpensive, the associated fees and infrastructure costs are the main financial barrier. Ask for a complete schedule of fees from both the RST Land Office and the BIA.

                                <p class="text-stone-700">Is the land already in use? Is it tribal trust land or an individual allotment? Requesting a site on available *tribal land* is the most straightforward path. Trying to build on an *allotment* is very difficult, as it requires getting a lease from all co-owners, which can be dozens of people.</p>

                                <p class="text-stone-700">The Tribe has a master plan that zones land for specific uses. You cannot get a homesite lease for a spot that is zoned for agriculture, conservation, or commercial development. Your request must be in an area planned for residential use.</p>

                                <p class="text-stone-700">This is a major practical barrier. Does the site have access to roads, water, electricity, and sewer/septic systems? If not, the cost to add this infrastructure can be extremely high. The Tribe often encourages building in areas where this infrastructure already exists or is planned.</p>
